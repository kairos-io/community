## :handshake: Kairos Community

Welcome to the Kairos community page! Here, you'll find all the necessary information to get involved, contribute, and engage with the Kairos project. 

## :bulb: About Kairos

[Kairos](https://kairos.io) is a meta-Linux distribution that allows you to create immutable, bootable Kubernetes and OS images for your edge devices as easily as writing a Dockerfile. It offers an optional P2P mesh with distributed ledger, automating node bootstrapping and coordination. Updating nodes is as simple as CI/CD: push a new image to your container registry, and let secure, risk-free A/B atomic upgrades take care of the rest.
