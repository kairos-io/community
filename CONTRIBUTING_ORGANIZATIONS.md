# Contributing Organizations

A **Contributing Organization** is an entity that actively supports the Kairos project by providing **one or more maintainers** to help with its development, governance, and community efforts. These organizations play a critical role in ensuring the project's sustainability and growth, aligning with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s (CNCF) **open governance model**. 

As Kairos is a CNCF project, its development is driven by a diverse set of contributors rather than a single vendor. Contributing organizations ensure that the project remains **vendor-neutral**, community-driven, and evolves in a way that benefits the broader ecosystem.

## Joining As a Contributing Organization

### On the Road to Incubation

Kairos is currently a **CNCF Sandbox Project**, meaning it is in the early stages of adoption but has strong potential to become a key technology in the cloud-native ecosystem. One of our key goals is to progress from **Sandbox to Incubation**, which requires demonstrating **diverse organizational backing** and a healthy contributor base. To achieve this, we need more than one contributing organization actively supporting the project. Your participation as a **contributing organization** would be instrumental in helping us reach this milestone and solidify Kairos as a leading cloud-native solution.

### Roadmap

Kairos follows a transparent and community-driven [**roadmap**](https://github.com/orgs/kairos-io/projects/2), which outlines planned features, priorities, and ongoing efforts. Organizations contributing maintainers are encouraged to align their contributions with this roadmap to ensure consistency and project-wide progress.

### Benefits for Contributing Organizations

By providing maintainers to Kairos, your organization can:

- **Influence Project Direction**: Actively shape the project's roadmap to align with industry needs and your strategic objectives.
- **Demonstrate Thought Leadership**: Establish your organization as a leader in the cloud-native and edge computing domains.
- **Foster Community Engagement**: Engage with a vibrant community of developers, users, and other stakeholders, facilitating knowledge exchange and collaboration.
- **Enhance Visibility**: Gain recognition within the CNCF community and at prominent industry events, showcasing your commitment to open-source innovation.

### Role and Responsibilities of a Contributing Organization

Contributing organizations are expected to:

- **Provide One or More Maintainers**: Assign engineers to actively contribute to the project and participate in its governance.
- **Participate in Public Planning Meetings**: Ensure that maintainers are engaged in discussions that define the project’s future.
- **Align Contributions with the Project Roadmap**: While contributing organizations may have specific interests, their work should align with the broader project goals and not be limited to company-specific priorities.
- **Support Community Growth**: Encourage maintainers to participate in discussions, mentor contributors, and promote the project at industry events such as KubeCon, CloudNativeCon, Open-Source Summit, and FOSDEM.

### Next Steps

We encourage organizations interested in contributing maintainers to Kairos to engage with us through our community channels. Your involvement will be instrumental in advancing Kairos towards CNCF Incubation and beyond, fostering innovation in the cloud-native landscape.
